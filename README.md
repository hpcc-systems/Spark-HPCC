# Spark-HPCC
Spark classes for working with HPCC clusters

There are two projects, DataAccess and Examples.

The DataAccess project contains the classes to support
reading data from a THOR cluster with a Spark RDD.  In
addition, te HPCC data is exposed as a Dataframe for
the convenience of the Spark developer.

The Examples project contains examples in Scala for
using HPCC THOR cluster based data in a Machine
Learning application.
